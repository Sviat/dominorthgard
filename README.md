# Dominorthgard
This is very basic Northgard mod template

# Usage
1. ``git clone https://github.com/Sviat/dominorthgard.git``
2. (optional) Create a new Mod in Northgard -> Creative -> Create Mod
3. Copy ``NorthgardDominationOnly/script.hx`` to your Mod directory (see below) near existing map.dat file
5. ?!
6. PROFIT!

# Help
* If you don't know what ``git clone`` means just download script from ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sviat/dominorthgard/main/NorthgardDominationOnly/script.hx``
* Your LOCAL mods directory: ``SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Northgard\mods\``
  * So your mod XYZ is located in: ``SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Northgard\mods\XYZ``
  * ...and you script should be in: ``SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Northgard\mods\XYZ\script.hx``
* Your SUBSCRIBED mods directory: ``SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\466560\``
* Mod that uses this very script in SteamWorkshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/managepreviews/?id=2648053701 (nota bene: id=2648053701)
  * Once uploaded, your mod will get unique ID from SteamWorkshop, so for example, combining knowledge from two previous points, it will be located locally in: ``SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\466560\2648053701\``
